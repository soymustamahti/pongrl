- ✅ Full training mode (2000 episodes)
- ✅ Evaluation mode with rendering
- ✅ Easy parameter adjustment

#### **VS Code Integration**

- ✅ Pre-configured tasks for training
- ✅ Quick test and full training options
- ✅ Model evaluation task
- ✅ Dependency installation task

### 🧪 Testing & Validation

#### **Implementation Test** (`test_implementation.py`)

- ✅ Component-by-component verification
- ✅ Mini training demo (5 episodes)
- ✅ Functionality validation
- ✅ Performance baseline establishment

### 📊 What Gets Generated

#### **During Training:**

1. **Console Output**: Real-time progress with metrics
2. **Model Checkpoints**: Saved every 500 episodes
3. **Intermediate Reports**: PDF reports at checkpoints
4. **Individual Plots**: PNG files for rewards and loss

#### **Final Results:**

1. **Trained Model**: Complete DQN weights
2. **Training Curves**: Episode rewards over time
3. **Loss Curves**: Learning progress visualization
4. **PDF Report**: Comprehensive training summary
5. **Statistics**: Mean, std, min, max performance metrics

### 🎯 Performance Expectations

Based on the test run:

- **Initial Performance**: -19 to -21 reward (random baseline)
- **Learning Progression**: Agent gradually improves over episodes
- **Target Performance**: Positive rewards after 1000+ episodes
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stable replay buffer management
- **Training Stability**: Consistent loss reduction

### 🔧 Usage Instructions

#### **Quick Test (100 episodes):**

```bash
python run.py --quick
```

#### **Full Training (2000 episodes):**

```bash
python train_pong.py
```

#### **Evaluate Trained Model:**

```bash
